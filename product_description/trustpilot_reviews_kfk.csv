martyb447,2 Jul 2025,"Constant good quality kitsBought quite a few kits from this company over the last year, must be around 10 so far as son loves them. This includes 3 new season 25/25 kits (Rangers & Juventus) Quality is good for the tops and shorts, socks so so but they are generally added as a freebie if you get them so can't complain.Delivery can take a few weeks so I'd be careful if needed for a specific date, but I don't think we've ever had any past the stated total business days, and you receive a emails telling you when there processing and when it's posted.Kits wash well etc and so far have lasted really well even with our son wearing them all the time including for training. Had 1 or 2 letters start to flake on names but that's the same with shop bought kits and easily fixed if we wanted (although this is after a season)Sizes are also good and correct, we buying size 24 for a reasonably Tall-ish 9yo and everything fits as you'd expect.Overall well worth the price, good quality kits and good delivery.Can't comment on customer service as so far had nothing to complain about but all general comms have been polite.Happy to recommend",5,2
